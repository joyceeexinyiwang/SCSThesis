# NOTES=Sourcing and Trust: Twitter Journalism in Ireland

(2015)

Abstract:
The analysis is built on a survey of journalists in Ireland conducted in 2013, which revealed that journalists in Ireland are heavy adopters of Twitter in their workflows, and in particular use social media for sourcing news leads and content. However, they are highly skeptical about the level of trust in social media. While this paper focuses on journalists in Ireland, the analysis of the relationship between trust, sourcing and verification reveals broader patterns about journalistic values, and how these values and practices operate in the new media landscape.

Twitter facilitated greater inclusion of ‘nonelite’ voices during rapid and often confusing developments

Broersma and Graham [1] refer to social networks as ‘huge pools’ of ‘collective intelligence’ that allow reporters to obtain information about ongoing events, to diversify voices, and to get in touch with informative sources.

Hermida [10] argues that the openness and instantaneity of Twitter has affected two key aspects of journalism as gatekeeping: sourcing and verification.

This study is drawn from the results of a national survey of journalists working in Ireland, across all types of organisations, beats, and media. The survey was open to all journalists -- full-time, part-time, casual, and freelance -- but results are limited to those who identify as professional journalists, which the survey defines as those who state that journalism forms a ‘significant part’ of their income.
