# Computing Political Preference among Twitter Followers

(CHI 2011)

- a novel method for computing preference among news outlets’ Twitter followers (not the *media bias* of news content itself)
- measure media bias

"we use **Congresspeople’s American for Democratic Action’s (ADA) scores** as a starting point for our scoring; however, we use Twitter Follow relationships rather than article citations."

> revisit this to see the **data sampling methods**

"on Twitter Republican members of Congress significantly outnumber members who are Democrats (127 to 103)...Republican Twitter users tend to have disproportionately more followers than Democrats."

"The distribution of scores among the Congress Followers and the sampled follower population is strongly bimodal, since it is based upon the congressional ADA scores which are bimodal. This is in contrast to other evidence that suggests the distribution of political ideologies among the general public is a more normal distribution, with most of the population as moderate" --> WHATT? Dude in 2018 the general public is def not a normal distribution

> In my work, I don't want to pay as much attention on the division between liberal and conservative as latent connections and similarities between groups regardless of political opinions.

> **To think about:**  
> what human sources the data comes from (demographics, sampling methods, time)  
> human v.s. organization  
> different properties of behavior patterns  
> how to measure properties from data  
> fairly make sense of data -- not to infer based on pre-existing notion, verify from multiple recent sources  
> keep in mind that *observable patterns* are different from *intentions*


> It is interesting that in the Discussion section of this work, the author suggests that a good understanding of the political preference of Twitter audience can be used for the recommendation system. This notion in 2018 is to be taken with caution, yet in 2011 researchers in the scientific field did not seem to look at it with critical eyes. 

> News outlets tend to have more control over who read their content than the people over what they get to read. Control is often one-way.
