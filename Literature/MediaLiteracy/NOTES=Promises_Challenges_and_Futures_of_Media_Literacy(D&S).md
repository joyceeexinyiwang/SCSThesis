*This paper focuses primarily on media literacy approaches to news consumption and evaluation.*

Media literacy = a process or a set of skills based on critical thinking
* youth participation
* teacher training and curriculum resources
* parental support
* policy initiatives
* evidence base construction

*There is a lack of comprehensive evaluation data of media literacy efforts.*

### HOW MEDIA LITERACY CAN HELP

Democratizing access to information had been regularly framed as a way to solve the world’s problems, but it now seemed this “democratizing” produced new problems of its own.

[Sam Wineburg and Sarah McGrew (2017), researchers of information credibility at Stanford]

The National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) held its third annual US Media Literacy Week.1 The American Library Association announced a new partnership with Stony Brook University to create “Media Literacy @ Your Library” to “train library workers to better equip their adult patrons to be discerning news consumers.” 2 Facebook announced its Journalism Project aimed at, among other things, improving the media literacy of its users.3 California lawmakers introduced two different bills (AB 155 and SB 135) to require teachers and education boards to create curricula and frameworks for media literacy (Mason, 2017). And the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation awarded $1 million in grants to 20 media literacy programs in the US.

**1992 National Leadership Conference on Media Literacy**

Leading media literacy theorist **Renee Hobbs**, in a body of work spanning over three decades, describes media literacy as a fluid practice that is both individual and communal and not simply inoculation against negative messaging but empowerment to engage with media as citizens

Many youth participation initiatives also publish research highlighting youth
voices, for instance: the Youth and Media project led by **Urs Gasser and Sandra Cortesi** at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University; Connected Learning Research Network and Connected Learning Alliance programs led by **Mimi Ito** at the University of California, Irvine;9 participatory culture work by **Henry Jenkins** at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism;10 and the learning initiative at MIT Media Lab.

Evidence base for media literacy: While **Ofcom** provides a strong example of a systematic national evidence base for media literacy, studies of youth media use, such as those conducted by Pew Internet Research, MediaSmarts, ACMA, EU Kids Online, Global Kids Online, Eurostat, and International Telecommunications Union (ITU),31 provide both baseline measures of youth media use and the relationship to education, and comparative data over time and devices. Comparative data across devices, time, and demographic groups enables evidence-based policy decisions, a critical component when addressing media regulation and education to avoid knee-jerk responses (Lemish, 2015; Bulger, Burton, O’Neill, & Staksrud, 2017).

university-based field-building research agendas can be found at: the Media Education Lab at University of Rhode Island; the Stanford History of Education Civic Online Reading Project, led by Sam Wineburg and Sarah McGrew;32 and the Department of Media and Communications at London School of Economics and Political Science

*...media literacy interventions typically focus on critical thinking rather than behavior change. *
>(my note: critical thinking as the basis for media literacy doesn’t demand media consumers to shy away from certain content, form a specific opinion, or request change in the overall information landscape. It simply asks the individual to reflect, self-protect, and engage responsibly. It expects individuals to hold themselves accountable and let the positive effects ripple. And the foundation of critical thinking, in this scenario, is evidence-based awareness.) 
...Kahne and Bowyer found media literacy education a stronger indication than political knowledge for those who could adopt *a critical stance when evaluating messaging, regardless of whether they agree or disagree with the position.*

### WHEN MEDIA LITERACY CAN FAIL

Media literacy has long focused on personal responsibility, which can not only imbue individuals with a false sense of confidence in their skills (Sanchez & Dunning, 2018; Kruger & Dunning, 1999) but also put the onus of monitoring media effects on the audience, rather than media creators, social media platforms, or regulators.

*Is media literacy about instilling confidence, about prompting behavior change, or about __creating new practices of media creation?__*

…media literacy research typically focuses on individual responsibility for discerning the truth or accuracy of messages. As platforms such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter increasingly personalize information access, individual responsibility becomes more challenging, especially when methods for serving information are not transparent. One challenge for research moving forward is determining expectations for how an individual can assess the reliability of information when the breadth of the corpus, e.g., what is included and excluded and why (and how it differs from information served to others), is neither visible nor accessible. It is necessary to rethink media literacy in the age of platforms.

>(my note: scientific evidence for media content creation online is crucial for the development of media literacy not only as an individual responsibility to discern, but as a shared societal awareness/standard to hold media content creators accountable.)

### FUTURE OF MEDIA LITERACY

This report identifies five broad recommendations for those interested in developing the future of media literacy:

a) develop a coherent understanding of the media environment,
Clearly, responsibility for accessing high-quality, reliable information does not rest solely with an individual, but with institutions, technology platforms, and nations, among other actors.

b) improve cross-disciplinary collaboration, 
Social psychology provides valuable research in decision-making
Political science work
Sociological work
Communication studies examining who is most susceptible to conspiracy theories (Pasek, Stark, Krosnick, & Tompson, 2015)

c) leverage the current media crisis to consolidate stakeholders, 
d) prioritize the creation of a national media literacy evidence base, 
e) develop curricula for addressing action in addition to interpretation.
