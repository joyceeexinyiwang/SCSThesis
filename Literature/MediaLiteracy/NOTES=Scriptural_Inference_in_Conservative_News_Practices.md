*This report is a detailed account of how individuals who describe themselves like Vice President Mike Pence, “Christian, a conservative, and a Republican, in that order,” (Drabold 2016) conceptualize truth.*

I argue that practices learned in Bible study are applied to media interpretation. —> form of media literacy

…this report argues that bad actors looking to exploit an audience disillusioned with mainstream media are taking advantage of this intellectual exploration. 

PragerU strategies

[Dennis Prager] rationalized that it is easy for anyone who “takes the Bible seriously” to continue to support Trump. He then slipped into a mode of scriptural inference and used the Biblical story of King David to reason that: “When the public’s good is concerned, the private sins of an individual are not the only thing to take into consideration…that the only question to be asked is—is this man good for America?”

By referencing back to one another and creating a dense network of interlocutors, PragerU is able to evoke a constant narrative aimed at discrediting liberal positions.

>My note: Media Literacy is inadequate if we as a society lack awareness in the latent patterns of control that algorithms enable content creators to impose on content consumers. It is crucial to understand evolving systems of information, especially the internet and social media platforms, the technology itself and the social order that the technology brings about, and how content creators manipulate readers not only with their content but with their strategies to take advantage of algorithmic systems. Media literacy is to combat oppression by human, and oppression by algorithms.

By clarifying the importance of scriptural inference, I also push back on the widespread solution of “media literacy” in response to the problem of “fake news.” While we must acknowledge the ever-growing threat of misinformation on-line, focusing on “fake news” as the reason why conservatives voted for Trump fails to acknowledge that many conservatives I observed regularly access, analyze, and evaluate an array of sources. Using this method of critical assessment, I saw how conservatives found inconsistencies in news coverage, supporting their convictions that the mainstream media is “fake news.”
