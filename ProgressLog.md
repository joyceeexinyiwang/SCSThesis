> - research on Youtube data could really benefit from video analysis technologies like what Will Crichton works on  
> - annotation scheme: network of interlocutors (forwarding, featuring, etc)  
> - how to formally characterize the behaviors of news accounts?  
> - How to detect patterns that consistently stand regardless of algorithms? Or meta-patterns of algorithms? We don't want to patterns to be useless when platforms change their design.
