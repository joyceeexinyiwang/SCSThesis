ORA
- friends/followers networks
- ask/mention/retweet networks
- each node: new agency? journalist? bots?
  - can add additional attributes to each Agent
- ORA generates reports

Stories behind interactions
  - read individual tweets in Excel
  - examine how individual agents interact with the new stories
  - group dynamics v.s. individual behaviors

“Computing Political Preference among Twitter Followers”  
"What Journalists Share: A Comparative Study of the National Press Corps in Australia and Germany"  
["Who’s behind that tweet? Here’s how 7 news orgs manage their Twitter and Facebook accounts"](http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/05/whos-behind-that-tweet-heres-how-7-news-orgs-manage-their-twitter-and-facebook-accounts/#disqus_thread) via Neiman Lab
> According to this Neiman Lab article, tweets with voices tend to generate the most interactions. Maybe consider **voice/no voice** as one of the distinguishing factors for social media-based journalistic behavior?

> This article is from 2014 and most news outlets had a manual component to their Twitter. However, as NLG technologies become more advanced these days, is the real personal voice still necessary? Are they using generated personal voices now?  

> Without knowing the automation mechanisms behind news corps Twitter accounts, how to distinguish between journalistic practices and understand their rippling effect?

D&S: "The Promises, Challenges, and Futures of Media Literacy"  
D&S: "Searching for Alternative Facts: Analyzing Scriptural Inference in Conservative News Practices"  
> - research on Youtube data could really benefit from video analysis technologies like what Will Crichton works on  
> - annotation scheme: network of interlocutors (forwarding, featuring, etc)  
> - how to formally characterize the behaviors of news accounts?  
> - How to detect patterns that consistently stand regardless of algorithms? Or meta-patterns of algorithms? We don't want to patterns to be useless when platforms change their design.
