## Problem Statement
I hope to explore new approaches to analyze the way different kinds of journalistic behaviors by official news accounts influence their readership on social media. Drawing from theories of journalism and network analysis techniques, I hope to develop a model that maps journalistic practices to readership changing patterns. 

The purpose of this work is to inform journalists and news organizations on the latent impact of their behaviors and provide evidence for media literacy education.

## Questions
- how to define "readership" in the context of social media-based journalism (which is a subspace of digital journalism, that is free and doesn't require membership or paywalls)?
- what to consider in describing the news reporting behaviors of social media accounts (timeliness, use of images or videos, mentioning, similarity to the print/web of the news org, topics, retweets, use of personal voice, etc.)?
- how do state media accounts differ from news accounts of democratic states in their posting behaviors?
- Without knowing the automation mechanisms or curatorial intentions behind news corps Twitter accounts, how to make sense of **observable** journalistic practices and understand their rippling effect? --> 

*"What the media says and how they say it, affect who is listening."*

## Semester Plan

- finding patterns in readership changes  
- data collection

December:
- poster presentation
