# Evaluating Journalistic Practices on Twitter Using Social Network Analysis
SCS Senior Honors Thesis  
Advised by Prof. Kathleen Carley

> I hope to explore the connection between journalistic practices of news orgs and news consumption on Twitter, drawing from empirical observations and dynamic social network analysis.

> The purpose of this work is to inform journalists and news organizations on the latent impact of their behaviors and provide evidence for media literacy education.

> *"What the media says and how they say it, affect who is listening."*

## Methods

Scenarios:
- @AP and @AJEnglish around the murder of Saudi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
- @AP and @PittsburghPG around the Tree of Life shooting.

Zoom in on stories of how pieces of news originated from a news corp get passed onto individual agents on Twitter.

Find changing patterns of mention/retweet/quote/reply networks and friends/follower networks as a news story unfold.


## Questions
- how to define "readership" in the context of social media-based journalism (which is a subspace of digital journalism, that is free and doesn't require membership or paywalls)?
- what to consider in describing the news reporting behaviors of social media accounts (timeliness, use of images or videos, mentioning, similarity to the print/web of the news org, topics, retweets, use of personal voice, violence/graphical content, etc.)?
- how do state media accounts differ from news accounts of democratic states in their posting behaviors?
- Without knowing the automation mechanisms or curatorial intentions behind news corps Twitter accounts, how to make sense of **observable** journalistic practices and understand their rippling effect? -->
