## Problem Statement
(?)
analyze readership of news accounts  
analyze social media news reporting behaviors  
prediction model --> from journalistic practices to readership changes  

## Questions
- how to define "readership" in the context of social media-based journalism (which is a subspace of digital journalism, that is free and doesn't require membership or paywalls)?
- what to consider in describing the news reporting behaviors of social media accounts (timeliness, use of images or videos, mentioning, similarity to the print/web of the news org, topics, retweets, etc.)?
- how do state media accounts differ from news accounts of democratic states in their posting behaviors?

## Semester Plan
