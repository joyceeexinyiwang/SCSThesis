### Porous Chambers, Echoes of Valence and Stereotypes: 

# A Network Analysis of Online News Coverage Interconnectedness Following a Nationally Polarizing Race-Related Event

### Abstract
"whether news organizations directly contribute to echo chambers through the hyperlinks they embed in online articles"

"..coverage of the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO"

"online news media exhibited weak community structure and high connectivity across news outlets"

**"Media sources were more likely to link to coverage that was similar to their own in terms of emotional valence and stereotype-relevant aspects of the events"**

**"While hyperlinking to diverse news sources may ameliorate fragmented information environments, selectively linking to similar coverage may contribute to growing polarization."**

### Intro & Background

"...people tend to be exposed to more attitude-congruent information simply by nature of how this information is marketed and communicated (i.e., __*de facto selective exposure*__ such as political advertisements targeting neighborhoods already more likely to support the advertised candidate)"
