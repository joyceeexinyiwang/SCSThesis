"...'news' means verifiable information in the public interest, and information that does not meet these standards does not deserve the label of news. In this sense then, **‘fake news’ is an oxymoron** which lends itself to undermining the credibility of information which does indeed meet the threshold of verifiability and public interest – i.e. real news."
