# NOTES=What Journalists Share: A Comparative Study of the National Press Corps in Australia and Germany
(2018)

comparative analysis of the news sharing choices of members of the Australian and German national press corps

"..some journalists have also seen social media as an opportunity for the development of a strong personal brand independent of the news outlets for which they worked..."

"...journalists who use social me-dia mainly to promote the news stories published by their own outlets (thus following the gatekeeping choices of their editors) could appear less attractive to potential social media followers than journalists who use their social media feeds to curate a stream of relevant news regardless of which outlet such stories first appeared in (thus engaging in **gatewatching** rather than **gatekeeping** [9])."

- "..should the journalist share a key story even if it originates from a rival outlet, or wait until their own outlet has published its own story?"
- "independent of their own institu-tional allegiances, journalists may also feel a professional solidarity with their colleagues at rival outlets, and acknowledge their good work by sharing it in their own feeds"
- "senior journalists may feel more empowered to break the social media rules set by their employers than junior cadets still fighting to establish a foothold in the in-dustry, and journalists at struggling commercial outlets may feel more pressure to support their own institution than staff at well-established or non-profit outlets (for instance, at leading public service broadcasters)"

**This work: investigate what content professional journalists share on Twitter**

### Dataset
- Australian Federal Press Gallery at Parliament House in Canberra
- German Bundespres-sekonferenz in Berlin

"171 accounts for Australia’s 303 members of the Press Gallery (56%), and 523 accounts for Germany’s 825 members of the Bundespressekonferenz (63%)"

"we have tracked all tweets (including @mentions and retweets) posted by these accounts since April 2016; we also identified any URLs included in these tweets, and resolved the t.co short URLs in tweets to their final targets"

### Preliminary analysis
Australia: 

"for the most part, then, Australian journalists appear to focus on promoting their own outlets’ news content through their tweeting activities."

Germany: 

"in spite of their greater diversity of URL sources, the journalists for these outlets still predominantly turn to a handful of key publications: rather than sharing content from a random set of other news sites"

"much more so than in the Australian case, these patterns result from the tweeting preferences of the individual journalists at each out-let."

"while in Australia each of the leading outlets was represented by several very actively tweeting Press Gallery members, the number of staff with active Twitter accounts for each outlet represented in the Bundespressekonferenz is a great deal lower, showing most likely the lesser importance German journalists and news outlets ascribe to actively using Twitter (and social media in general). The URL sharing patterns we observe for each out-let in our German dataset more directly reflect the individual choices made by their journalists, therefore, rather than the aggregate of such choices across a larger team."

### Discussion
"Recent entrants to the Australian market, such as Guardian Australia or the Australian edition of Huffington Post, appear particularly concerned to have their journalists promote their own content; more established news organisa-tions also still remain focussed on their own products, how-ever."

"By contrast, the considerably more diverse range of sources shared on Twitter by the leading journalists in the German Bundespressekonferenz appears to point to a greater level of independence for journalists as they select content for their Twitter feeds. We interpret this in part as a result of the rather lower degree of attention paid to Twitter by Ger-man news outlets; in the absence of firm institutional guide-lines about what links journalists should share here, perhaps they feel emboldened to look beyond their own outlets more often."
