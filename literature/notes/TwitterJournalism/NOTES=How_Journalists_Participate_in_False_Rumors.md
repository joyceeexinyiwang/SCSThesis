# NOTES=Engage Early, Correct More: How Journalists Participate in False Rumors Online During Crisis Events

(CHI 2018)

>my notes: good, comprehensive article. should come back

Abstract: ...Our findings show journalists engaging earlier than non-journalists in the spread and the correction of false rumors. However, compared to other users, journalists are (proportionally) more likely to deny false rumors. Journalists are also more likely to author original tweets and to be retweeted—underscoring their continued role in shaping the news. Interestingly, journalists scored high on “power user” measures, but were distinct from other power users in significant ways—e.g. by being more likely to deny rumors. 

Balancing the competing goals of getting information out in a timely way while assuring its accuracy is both a daily challenge for individual journalists and a perennial one within the profession. 

“power users” — accounts that have a lot of followers 
> (my notes: this could be an important attribute to consider)

The complex process of communication and interaction—information sharing and curation— is often conceptualized as one of collective sense-making, where people come together to make sense of available information in a constantly changing environment….(one expression of collective sense-making is rumoring)...Rumors often arise in the crisis context due to high levels of anxiety and uncertainty, as well as when official sources are insufficiently timely.

ICT = Information and communication technology

Amidst the backdrop of online convergence and crowd participation, the role of the journalist is changing. Networked ICTs have been a disruptive force in how journalism is done and by whom. These technologies are alternatively viewed as enabling citizens to either supplant professional journalists [47] or complement or augment their work in some fashion [13,16,37]. 

The immediacy of social media puts strong pressure on journalists to post first, fact-check later [1,11,27].

Research questions:
RQ0: How do journalists compare with other power users? 
RQ1: How do journalists’ posting behaviors (e.g. number of posts) differ systematically from non-journalists? 
>(notes: this is very similar to what I am planning to explore; I can look for gaps in this research, or approach from a different angle, which is, the behavior of ’official news account’ instead of individuals, the meta-behavior patterns rather than content, and comparing across news accounts instead of comparing journalist accounts against non-journalists accounts)

Numerous studies find Twitter has become a normal part of journalists’ work routines [14,25,31,35,45]. Essentially, this work argues that journalists are professional tweeters. 

RQ2: How do journalists’ rumor-correcting behaviors differ from the general population? 
RQ3: How do the temporal characteristics of journalist behavior differ from the general population?
RQ4: Are tweets from journalists more likely to be retweeted?

>my notes: it is important to distinguish between causation and correlation when I construct my hypothesis and arguments

Taken together, though our evidence does not support a “publish first, correct later” strategy, it does support an “engage earlier, correct more” one. 

>my notes: following the format of this paper, I can have a list of research questions and hypotheses in my paper, and tackle them individually but (hopefully) within the same process/framework
