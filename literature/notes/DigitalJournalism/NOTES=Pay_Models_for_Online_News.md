"...the essential function of digital journalism is to adopt digital technologies while researching, producing and delivering news and information to media-literate communities.[6]"

Sustainability-related challenges that digital news faces:
- The economic structures of mainstream media mainly based on **austerity and advertising revenues are hardly applicable** to online news. Digital advertising is monopolised by major companies such as Facebook or Google[7].
- The largest part of news users is **unwilling to pay** for online news, regarding it as free content.
- Online competition for peoplesâ€™s attention has soared, including from **social media and citizen journalists** [8].
- Journalism is **not a viable model by itself**, requiring additional revenue sources next to reader fees.

## Models that digital news uses to generate income from its audiences

### Paywalls
*Hard paywalls* require users to pay for (almost) all the content (e.g., The Times)  
*Soft paywalls* let readers access a certain amount of content without paying and only invite them to buy a subscription once they want to read more articles beyond that amount [14]. (e.g., NYT)

### Subscriptions
= a way to extend the period of selling the product or the service and at the same time receiving a periodic payment from a subscriber [19]


### Freemium models

## Refusal to pay
The most common of reasons is represented by the attitude of people who believe that the amount they have spent on the hardware, software and connection should be enough to receive free content of digital news. [30]

In the second case, people from lower socio-economic groups are left behind by being able to access only a minimal range of news. According to this tendency, pay models might bring a broader issue of social inequality creating a new digital divide [31].
