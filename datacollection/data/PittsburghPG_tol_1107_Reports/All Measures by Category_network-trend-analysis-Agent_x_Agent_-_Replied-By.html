<h2>Agent-Level Trend Analysis</h2>

<p>These are line charts of measure values for the agent nodes that are top ranked in the overall (union) meta-network for the given measure. The values are plotted across all time periods.</p>
<p>Network: Agent x Agent - Replied-By</p>
<h3>betweennessCentrality</h3>
<p>The Betweenness Centrality of node v in a network is defined as: across all node pairs that have a shortest path containing v, the percentage that pass through v. When the data is weighted, the higher the weight the more value the link has. Individuals or organizations that are potentially influential are positioned to broker connections between groups and to bring to bear the influence of one group on another or serve as a gatekeeper between groups. This agent occurs on many of the shortest paths between other agents. The scientific name of this measure is betweenness centrality and it is calculated on agent by agent matrices.</p>

<h3>bonacichPowerCentrality</h3>

<h3>closenessCentrality</h3>
<p>The closeness of a node to the other nodes in a network (also called out-closeness). Loosely, Closeness is the inverse of the sum of distances in the network from a node to all other nodes.</p>

<h3>contributionCentrality</h3>
<p>This computes Eigenvector Centrality on a transformation of the input network. Link values are transformed to be proportional to the dissimilarity of the nodes they connect. The intuition is that a link between two nodes with the same neighbors is not an important link since neither node gains new neighbors by the connection. Specifically, each link is weighted by the inverse of the Jaccard similarity of its nodes.</p>

<h3>egoBetweennessCentrality</h3>

<h3>eigenvectorCentrality</h3>
<p>Leaders of strong cliques are individuals or organizations who are collected to others that are themselves highly connected to each other. In other words, if you have a clique then the individual most connected to others in the clique and other cliques, is the leader of the clique. Individuals or organizations who are connected to many otherwise isolated individuals or organizations will have a much lower score in this measure then those that are connected to groups that have many connections themselves. The scientific name of this measure is eigenvector centrality and it is calculated on agent by agent or organization by organization matrices.</p>

<h3>exponentialRankCentrality</h3>
<p>Computes the Exponential Ranking Centrality that defines the centrality of a node as its trustworthiness, which is based on the degree to which other nodes trust it. The link values define initial trust between nodes: positive values indicate trust and negative values distrust (negative link values can be used). This measure is similar to eigenvector centrality.</p>
