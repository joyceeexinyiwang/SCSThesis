[OPINION: 0.65/1.0]'For more on how this person was radicalized, see the great reporting from the team at @PittsburghPG, @richelord @huffakingit @LizNavratil:  https://t.co/dUjuX8KYBE  4/4'

   [OPINION: 0.004166666666666667/1.0]"That's when these garbage, hateful people knew there'd be no repercussions for spreading their vile hatred through the internet, ultimately infecting the minds of people like Bowers. To say Trump is blameless is to assume shootings happen in a vacuum. They don't. 3/4"

      [OPINION: 0.22499999999999998/1.0]'That this perpetrator opposed your boss as a "Jewish puppet" does not acquit Trump of his role in winking and nodding at the white nationalists who shout "Heil Trump" and "Jews will not replace us." "Good people on both sides"? Really? 2/4'

         [OPINION: 0.12708333333333333/1.0]"Shootings don't happen in a vacuum. The gunman in this case didn't wake up one day randomly wanting to kill Jews. He was radicalized in an environment facilitated by the same extremist elements who were emboldened by your boss's political ascent. 1/4 https://t.co/qb5d8iQ3Vp"

            [OPINION: 0.1/1.0]'I have struggled w/ what happened in Pitts bc it’s so similar to what happened in Chas. The country was very racially divided @ the time. We didn’t once blame Pres. Obama. We focused solely on the lives lost &amp; their families. Have some respect for these families &amp; stop the blame.'

[OPINION: 0.024999999999999994/1.0]'“In the 19 days before Bowers carried out his act of mass murder, he posted or reposted memes and comments at least 68 times,” the Southern Poverty Law Center found. Many of those reflected “antisemitic conspiracy theories."  https://t.co/wBjQ0yM6iJ via @PittsburghPG'
